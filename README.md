# Titanic-Survival-Prediction

🚢⚓️ Exciting News! I am delighted to share my recent project: Developing a Titanic Survival Prediction Model using Python! 📈✨

Using advanced data science techniques, I built a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of passenger survival on the Titanic. 🌊⛴️

🔍 Explored historical data 📊, engineered new features 🛠️, and applied Python techniques 🤖 to predict survival probabilities based on passenger information.

🌟 Thrilled about the insights gained and the potential applications of data science in historical event analysis. Stay tuned for more exciting projects! 🚀
